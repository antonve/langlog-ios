## What is LangLog?

It's an app to time track your language learning. This code base is still a work in progress, a lot of things like CI haven't been setup yet.

## Setup

1. Setup [backend](https://github.com/antonve/logger-api/) locally

This should be enough to build and run the app locally. To update pods:

2. `$ bundle install`
3. `$ bundle exec pod update`
